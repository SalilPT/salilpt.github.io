		<!--General Description-->
		<section>
			<p><i>Prickly Testers</i> is a card game I made in 2020. 
			It's about strategically attacking and defending against other players using cards drawn from a shuffled deck until only one player remains.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The itch.io page for it is <a href="https://salilpt.itch.io/artg80g-final-project-prickly-testers">here</a>.</p>

		<!--How It Was Made-->
		<section>
			<h2>How It Was Made</h2>
			<!--TODO: Talk about how I came up with the original game concept and mood boards-->
			<p>I made a color palette using <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel">color.adobe.com</a>. 
			The colors I used for that palette were #76C5FA, #50C1D9, #51C2BA, #348C70, and #338A59. 
			I chose these because they reminded me of cacti and laboratories, which were related to my idea for the game at the time.
			All of the art for the game was made using Adobe Illustrator, which means that it uses only vector graphics.
			<br>
			<br>
			To play it, I used <a href="https://playingcards.io/">playingcards.io</a> to create and customize a room suited to play the game digitally. 
			Since that site allows for online play, I was able to playtest it with friends and classmates.</p>

		<!--Scrapped Rules and Mechanics-->
		<section>
			<h2>List of Scrapped Rules and Mechanics</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>In the original prototype, the counterattack value of a card was dealt in full back to an attacker.</li>
				<li>At one point in development, there was a "Nullify" option which would allow a defender to cancel all incoming damage.</li>
				<li>Attacking players did not have the option to discard a card and then end their turn. Attacks were always required.</li>
				<li>The starting HP of players used to be the number of players times 8. This made games go on for too long.</li>
				<li>Attack/Defense values didn't go all the way to 9. Also, there were no cards with 0 Counterattack.</li>
			</ul>
