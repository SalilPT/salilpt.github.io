		<p><i>Prickly Testers</i> is a card game I made in 2020. It's about strategically attacking and defending against other players using cards drawn from a shuffled deck.</p><br>
		<p>The itch.io page for it is <a href="https://salilpt.itch.io/artg80g-final-project-prickly-testers">here</a>.</p>
		<h2>How It Was Made</h2>
		<p>All of the art for the game was made using Adobe Illustrator. This means that the card art uses only vector graphics.</p>
